MPSSH - Mass Parallel Secure Shell
(c) 2005-2012 Nikolay Denev <ndenev@gmail.com>

This program reads list of machines from text file (one hostname at line)
and connects to all of the machines by creating upto N parallel ssh
sessions. Then it reads the output from each ssh session and prints it on
the screen prepending the machine name and the descriptor name (stdout/err).
The number of parallel sessions N, the filename of the list of machine
and the username to login as are user configurable.

mpssh uses the ssh binary from the openssh package.
There are no other external dependancies
mpssh depends on preexisting passwordless authentication method such as
pubkey or kerberos to work.
mpssh supports alternative ssh ports and different usernames per host.
Also the hosts can be grouped and one can execute the same command on all hosts in
a group by specifying the group label with the -l option.
